GOD THE FATHER

Hast given us joys, tendet and true,
Yet all with wings, .

So that we see, gleaming on high,
Diviner things.

Ithank Thee‚ Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store:

We have enough, yet not too much

' To long for more,-

A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.

Ι thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls,
Though amply blest,

Can never find, although they seel,
A perfect rest,

Nor ever shall, until they lean
On Jesus' breast.

VI

· Gon moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform3
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-falling skill

He treasures up His bright designs
And works His sovereign will.
