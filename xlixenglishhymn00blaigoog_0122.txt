102 ΟΝ THE BRINK

A lew more Sabbaths here
Shall cheer us on our way,
And we shall reach the endless rest,

The eternal Sabbath day:
Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul for that sweet day3

O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

’Tis but a little while
And He shall come again
Who died that we might live, who lives
That we with Him may reign:
Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul lor that glad day3

O wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

XLIV

Bnrnr lile is here our portion,
Brief sorrow, short-lived care3

The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there.

Ο happy retribution t
Short toil, eternal rest 3
For mortals and for sinners
A mansion with the blest!
