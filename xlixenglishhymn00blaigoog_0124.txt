ΟΝ ΤΗΕ BRINK

There grief is turned to pleasure,
Such pleasure as below

No human voice can mter,
No human heart can know.

And now we fight the battle,
. But then shall wear the crown
01 11111 and everlasting

And passionless renown;

And now we watch and struggle,
And now we live in hope,
And Zion, in her anguish
With Babylon must cope;

But He whom now we trust in
Shall then be seen and known,

And they that see and know Him
Shall have Him sor their own.

Yes! God, our King and Portion,
In fulness 01 His grace,

We then shall see 101 ever,
And worship faceto face.

ΤΗΕ sands 01 time are sinlring3
The dawn 01 heaven breaks;
The summer mom I’ve sighed sor,
The fair, sweet morn, awalres,
