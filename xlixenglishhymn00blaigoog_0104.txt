HOLY ASPIRATION

Let love awake, and pay
Her evening sacrifice.

As Christ, upon the cross
In death reclined,
Into His Father’s hands
l-Iis parting soul resigned,

So now herself my soul

Would wholly give

Into His sacred charge
In whom all spirits live,

So now beneath His eye
Would calmly rest-
Without a wish or thought

Abiding in the breast‚

Save that His will be done
Whate'er betide-

Dead to herself, and dead
In Hirn to all beside.

Thus would I live3 yet now
Not l, but He
In all His power and love
Henceforth alive in me,

One sacred Trinity,
One Lord Divine;
Mysell sor ever His,
And He for ever mine.
