82 HOLY ASPIRATION

XXXVI

Jasus, these eyes have never seen
That radiant form of Thine3
= The vale of sense hangs dark between
Thy blessed faceand mine.

I see Thee not, l hear Thee not,
Yet art Thou ost with me 3

And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot
As where I meet with Thee.

Like some bright dream that comes unsought
When slumbers o’er me roll,

Thine image ever fills my thought,
And charms my ravished soul.

Yet, though I have not seen, and still
Must rest in faith alone,

Ι love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,
Unseen but not unknown.

When death these mortal eyes shall seal,
And still this throbblng beart,

The rending veil shall Thee reveal
All glorious as Thou art.

XXXVII

Tne sun is sinking last,
The daylight dies3
