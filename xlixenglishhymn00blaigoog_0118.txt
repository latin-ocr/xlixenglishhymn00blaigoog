ΟΝ ΤΗΕ BRINK

.ln vain with larish kindness
The gifts of God are strewn,
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone.

Can we, whose souls are lIghted
Ι With wisdom from on high,
Can we to men benighted ,

The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! Ο Salvation!

The joyful sound proclaim,
Till each remotest nation

Has learnt Messiah's name.

Waft‚ walt, ye winds, His story,

And you, ye waters‚ roll,
Till, like a sea of glory‚

It spreads from pole to pole3
Till o’er our ransomed nature

The Lamb for sinners slaIn,
Redeemer, King, Creator,

In bliss returns to reign.

XLIII

A rnw more years shall roll,
A few more seasons corne,

And we shall be with those that rest
Asleep within the tomb:
