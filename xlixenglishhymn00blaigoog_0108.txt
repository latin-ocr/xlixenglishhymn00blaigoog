THE CHURCH

She waits the consummation
Of peace sor evermore,
Till with the vision glorious

Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won.
O happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we,

Like them, the meek and lowa,
On high may dwell with Thee.

XXXIX

Prrrnsnrrr are Thy courts above,

¹ In the land of light and love,

Pleasant are Thy courts below,
In this land of sin and woe.
O my spirit longs and saints
For the converse of Thy saints,
For the brightness of Thy face,
King of glory, God of grace!

Happy birds that sing and fly
Round Thy altars, Ο Most High1
Happier souis that find a rest
In a heavenly Father's breast!
