Nor all the blood of beastS,
On Jewish altars slain‚

Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away the stain.

But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away,

A sacrifice os nobler name
And richer blood than they.

My saith would lay her hand

On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,

And there consess my sin.

My soul looks back to see

· The burdens Thou didst bear

When hanging on the cursed trec,
And hopes her guilt was there.

Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove3

We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
And sing His bleeding love.

Aonnr the mom os gladness,
The morn of light, is here,
