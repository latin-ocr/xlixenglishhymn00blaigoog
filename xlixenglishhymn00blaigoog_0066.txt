46 TRUST AND PEACE

Just as Ι am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt

F ightings and sears within, without,
Ο Lamb of God, Ι come.

Just as Ι am, poor, wretched, blind,-

sight, riches, healing os the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
Ο Lamb of God, 1 come.

Just as Ι am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt velcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve3

Because Thy promise I believe,
0 Lamb of God, 1 come.

Just as Ι am-Thy love unknown

Has broken every barrier down—

N ow to be Thine, yea‚ Thine alone,
Ο Lamb of God, 1 come.

Just as I am, of that free love
The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,
Here sor a season, then above,

Ο Lamb of God, Ι come.
