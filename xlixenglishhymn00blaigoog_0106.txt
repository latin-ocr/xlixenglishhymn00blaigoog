THE CHURCH

XXXVIII ’

Tun Chnrch's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord:
She is His new creation
By water and the word3

From heaven He carne and songht her
To be His holy bride:

With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.

Elect srorn every nati0n‚
Yet one 0’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one saith, one birth3
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed,

By schisms rent asunder,

By heresies distressed,
Yet saints their wateh are keeping,
Their cry goes up, ‘How long?'
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

’Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
