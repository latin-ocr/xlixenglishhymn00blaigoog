ΟΝ THE BRINK

Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day3

Ο wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hills of time,
And we shall be where suns are not,—

A far serenet clime:
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day3

Ο wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,

And we shall be where tempests cease,
And surges swell no more:
Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul for that calm day,
Ο wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o'er,
A few more toils, a few more tears,

And we shall weep no more:
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that blest day,

Ο wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.
