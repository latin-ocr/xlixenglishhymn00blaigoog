TRUST AND PEACE

His right hand me embraces,
I on His breast recline.

Ι love the name of Jesus,
Immanuel Christ, the Lord;

Like fragrance on the breezes‚
His name abroad is poured.

l long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving‚ lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father’s holy Child.
Ι long to be with Jesus,
Amid the heavenly throng‚
To sing with saints His praises,
To learn the angels’ song.

XXV

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!

It soothes his sorrows, heals his woundS‚
And drives away his sear. ’

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast3

'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

Dear Name! the rock on which l build,
My shield and hiding-place,
