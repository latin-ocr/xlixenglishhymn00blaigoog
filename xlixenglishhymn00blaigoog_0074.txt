TRUST AND PEACE

When ends life's transient dream,
When death’s cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll,
Blest Saviour‚ then, in love,
Fear and distrust remove3
Ο bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.

XXIV

Ι LAv my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accurshd load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
To wash my crimsoh stains
White in His blood most precious‚
Till not a spot remains.

Ι lay my wants on Jesus3
All fulness dwells in Him3
He heals all my diseaseS,
He doth my soul redeem.
Ι lay my griefs on Jesus,
My humens, and my cares3
He from them all releases‚
He all my sorrows shareS.

I rest my soul on Jesus,
This weary soul of mine3
