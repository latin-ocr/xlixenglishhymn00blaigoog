THE JUDGMENT

No gloomy fears their souls dismay3
His presence sheds eternal day
On those prepared to meet Him.

The ungodly‚ filled with guilty fears,
Behold His wrath prevailing 3

In woe they nse, but all their tears
And sighs are unavailing:

The day of grace is past and gone:

Trembling they stand before His throne,
All unprepared to meet Him.

Great Judge, to Thee our prayers we pour,
In deep abasement bending 3

Ο shield us through that last dread hour,
Thy wondrous love extending:

May we, in this our trial day,

With faithful hearts Thy word obey,

’ And thus prepare to meet Thee.

FOR ever with the Lord!
Arnen, so let it be:

Life from the dead is in that word,
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,

Yet nightly pitch my moving tent ⁴
,Α day's march nearer horne.
