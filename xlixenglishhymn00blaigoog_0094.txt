HOLY ASPIRATION

Tears sor all woes, a heart sor every plea3
Come, Friend ol sinnem, thus abide with me.

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile3
And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, olt as I left Thee:

On to the close, Ο Lord, abide with me.

l need Thy presence every passing hour 3

What but Thy grace can soil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine‚ Ο abide with me.

1 sear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;

Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph stillis Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,

Shine through the gloom‚ and point me to the siries,

Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows
fiee:

In life and death, Ο Lord‚ abide with me.

XXXIII

O roa a closer wall< with God‚
A calm and heavenly frame,

A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb l
