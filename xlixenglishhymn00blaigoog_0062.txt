42 THE GOSPEL INVITATION

‘Is I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?'
‘Not till earth and not till heaven
Pass away 1'

‘Finding following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless?'
‘Angels, martyrs, saints, and prophets
Answer, “ Yes Ι ”’

‘Cone unto Me, ye weary,
And I vill give you rest.’

Oblessed voice of Jesus,

Which comes to hearts oppressed!
It tells os benediction,

of pardon, grace, and peace,
Oi joy that hath no ending,

Of love that cannot cease.

‘Come unto Me, ye wanderers,
And I will give you light.’

Ο loving voice of Jesus,
Which comes to cheer the night!

Our hearts were filled with sadness‚
And we had lost our way;

But morning brings us gladness,
And songs the break of day.
