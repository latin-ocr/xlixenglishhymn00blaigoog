ΟΝ ΤΗΕ BRINK

The patriot’s voice to teach and ronse,
The monarch's crown to light the brovs? '
He giveth His beloved sleep.

‘Sleep soft, beloved l’ we sometimes say,
Who have no tune to charm away
Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep3
But never doleful dream again
Shall break the happy slumber when
He giveth His beloved sleep.

O earth so lull of dreary noises!

Ο men with wailing in your voices!
Ο ἀείνὲά gold the wailers heap!

O snite, Ο curse that o'er it fall l—

God strikesa silence through you all
And giveth His beloved sleep.

His dews drop mutely on the hill,
His cloud above it saileth still,
Though on its slope men sow and reap3
More soltly than the dew is shed‚
Or cloud is floated overhead‚
He giveth His beloved sleep.

Ay, men may wonder while they scan

A living, thinking, feeling man
Conlormed in such a rest to keep3

But angels say, and through the word

I think their happy smile is heard-
He giveth His beloved sleep.
