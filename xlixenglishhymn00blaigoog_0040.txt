Jesus ciims‘r

IX

wnm I survey the wondrous cross μ
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on ali my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my G0d;

Α11 the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See! from His head, His hands, His ieet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thoms compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too smail;
Love so amming, so divine,
Demands my soul, my lise, my all.

X

Timim is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;

And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose. all their guilty stains.
