TRUST AND PEACE

XXI

Rocx of AgeS, clest for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee3

Let the water and the blood,

From Thy niven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure:

Cleanse me from its guilt and power,

Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law's demands,
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears sor ever flow,

All for sin could not atone:
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling3
Naked, come to Thee for dress3
Helpless‚ look to Thee sor grace,
Foul, I to the fountain fly;

Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,

See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages‚ cleft forme,
Let me hide mysels in Thee.
