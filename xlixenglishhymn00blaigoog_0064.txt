44 TRUST AND PEACE

‘Come unto Me, ye fainting,
And 1 will give you lise!
Ο cheering voice ol Jesus‚
Which comes to aid our strile!
The soe is stern and eager,
The fight is fierce and long 3
But Thou hast made us mighty,
And stronger than the strong.

‘And whosoever cometh
Ι will not cast him out.'

Ο welcome voice of Jesus,
Which drives away our doubt,

Which calls us, very sionem,
Unworthy though we be

Ol love so free and boundless‚
To come, dear Lord‚ to Thee!

XX

Jusu as 1 am, without one plea
’ But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thoe,
O Lamb ol God, 1 come.

Just us I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul ol one darlc blot,

To Thee‚ whose blood can cleanse each spot,
Ο Lamb of God, I come.
