ιο GOD THE FATHER

Such blessings from Thy gracious hand

Our humble prayers implore;
And Thou shalt be our chosen God,
And portion evermore.

Mw God, I thank Thee, who hast made
The earth so bright‚

So full of splendour and of joy,
Beauty and light3

So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.

I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made

Joy to abound‚

So many gentle thoughts and deeds
Circling us round

That in the darkest spot of earth

Some love is found.

I thank Thee more that all our joy
Is touched with pain,

That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns romain,

So that earth’s bliss may be our guide‚
And not our chain.

For Thou, who knowew, Lord, how soon
Our weak heart clings,
