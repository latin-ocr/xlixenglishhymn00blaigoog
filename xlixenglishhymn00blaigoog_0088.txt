And then with Him go hand in hand
Far into bliss. . ⁴

Wnnn our heads are bowed with woe,
When our bitter tears o'erflow‚

When we mourn the lost, the dear,
Jesu5‚ Man of SorrOWS, hear!

Thou our throbbing flesh hast worn3
Thou our mortal griefs hast borne;
Thou hast shed the human tear:
Jesus, Man ot SorroWS, hear!

When the suilen death-bell tolls
For our own departing souis,
When our final doom is near,
Jesus, Man of Sorrows, hear!

Thou hast bowed the dying head;
Thou the blood of lise hast shed;
Thou hast filled a mortal bier:
Jesus, Man of Sorrows, hear!

When the heart is sad within
With the thought of all its. sin,
When the spirit shrinks with sear,
Jesus, Man of Sorrows, hear!
