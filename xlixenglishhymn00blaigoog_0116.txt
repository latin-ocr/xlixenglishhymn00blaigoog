CHRISTIAN SERVICE

But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain3

Gates of heli can never
'Gainst that Church prevail;

We have Christ's own promise,
And that cannot fail.

Onward‚ then, ye people!
Join our happy throng3
Blend with ours your voices

In the triumph song,
‘Glory, laud, and honour

Unto Christ the King i'
This through countless ages

Men and angels sing.

XLII

FRou Greenland’s icy mountains‚
From India's coral strand,
Where Afric's sunny sountains
Roll down their golden sand,
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon’s isle,
Though every prospect pleases‚

And only man is vile3
