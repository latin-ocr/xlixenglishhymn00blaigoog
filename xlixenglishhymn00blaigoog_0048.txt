Jesvs effinse

The Church on earth rejoices
To J‘oin with these to-day3
In every tongue and nation
She calls her sons to pray,
Across the Northern snovv-fields‚
Beneath the Indian palms,
She rpakes the same pure offering,

Ι And sings the same sweet psalms.

‘Glory be to Jesus !' etc.

Tell out, sweet bells, His praises!
Sing, children, sing His name!
Still louder and still further
His mighty deeds proelaim‚
Till all whom He redeemed
Shall own Him Lord and King,
Till every knee shall worship,
And every tongue shall sing.
‘Glory be to Jesus l' etc.

XIII

Gornrv harps are sounding,
Angel voices ring, ·

Pearly gates are opened,
Opened for the King.

Christ, the King of Glory,

JesuS, King of Love,

Is gone up in triumph
To His throne above.
