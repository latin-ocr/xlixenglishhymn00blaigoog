TRUST AND PEACE

Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure withm.

Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee3

Spring Thou up within my beart,
Rise to all eternity.

XXIII

Mv saith looks up to Thee‚

Thou Lamb of Calvam,
Saviour Divine:

Now hear me while I pray,

Take all my guilt away,

Ο let me from this day

Be wholly Thine.

May Thy rich grace impart

Strength to my fainting beart,
My zeal inspire3

As Thou hast died forme,

Ο may my love to Thee

Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire.

While life’s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide3

Bid darkness turn to day,
WIpe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.
