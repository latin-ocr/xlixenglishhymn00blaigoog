HOLY ASPIRATION

Thou the shame, the grief, hast known,
Though the sins were not Thine own3
Thou hast deigned their load to bear:
Jesus‚ Man of Sorrows, hear!

XXXI '

Lm, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on;

The night is dark, and Ι am far from home;
Lead Thou me on.

Keep Thou my seet; I do not ask to see

The distant scene,-0ne step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on 3

I loved to choose and see my path, but now
Lead Thou me on3

1 loved the garish day, and, spite of fearS,

Pride ruled my will: remember not past yearS.
