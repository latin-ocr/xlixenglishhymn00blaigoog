JESUS CHRIST

And earth itsell looks (aiter,
And heaven itself more near:
The bells, like angel voices,
Speak peace to every breast 3 “
And all the land lies quiet
To keep the day os rest.
‘Glory beto Jesus l'
Let all His children say3

He rose again, He rose again, '
On this glad day!

Again‚ 0 loving Saviour‚
The children of Thy grace
Prepare themselves to seek Thee
Within Thy chosen place.

Our song shall rise to greet Thee,
1f Thou our hearts wilt raise3
If Thou our lips wilt open,
Our mouth shall show Thy praise.
‘Glory be to Jesus l’ etc.

The shining choir of angels
That rest not day or night,
The crovned and palm-decked martyrs,
The saints arrayed in white,
The happy lambs of Jesus
In pastures fair above,—
These all adore and praise Him
Whom we too praise and love. .
‘Glory beto Jesus l' etc.
