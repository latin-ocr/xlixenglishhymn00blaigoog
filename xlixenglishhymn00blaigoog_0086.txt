' DISCIPLINE

XXIX

I xhow not if or dark or bright
Shall be my lot,

If that wherein my hopes delight
Be best or not.

11 may be mine to drag for years
Toil’s heavy chain3

Or day and night my meat be tears
Or bed of pain.

Dear faces may surround my hearth
With smiles and glee‚

Or Ι may dwell alone, and mirth
Be strange to me.

My barque is wasted to the strand
By breath divine3

And on the helm there rests a hand
Other than mine.

One who has known in storms to sail
I have on board:

Above the raging of the gale
Ι have my Lord.

He holds me when the billows smite‚
I shall not fall3

If sharp 'tis short3 is long 'tis light,
He tempers all.
