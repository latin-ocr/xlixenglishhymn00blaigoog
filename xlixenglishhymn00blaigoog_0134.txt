ΟΝ ΤΗΕ BRINK

Happy‚ still in God confiding‚

F ruitful‚ isin Christ abiding‚

Holy‚ through the Spirit’s guiding3
All must be well.

We expect a bright to-morrow3
All will be well.

F aith can sing through days of sorrow,
ιΑΗ, all is well.'

On our F ather’s love relying,

Jesus every need supplying,

Or in living or in dying,
All must be well.

Ι Gnnns God, what do I see and hear?
The end of things created :

The Judge of all men doth appear
On clouds os glory seated:

The trumpet soundS, the graves restore

The dead which they contained before;
Prepare‚ my soul, to meet Him.

The dead in Christ are first to rise
At that last trumpet’s sounding;
Caught up to meet Him in the skieS,
With joy their Lord surrounding:
