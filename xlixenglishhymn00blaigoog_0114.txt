CHRISTIAN SERVICE

XLI

Ortwnttn! Christian soldiers‚
Marching as to war,

With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.

Christ, the Royal Master,
Leads against the soe3

Forward into battle,
See! His banners go.

At the sign of triumph
Satan’s legions flee3

On then, Christian soldiers‚
On to victory!

Hell's foundations quiver

At the shout os praise3
Brothers‚ lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.

Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of G0d3
Brothers‚ we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope, in doctrine,
One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish‚
Kingdoms rise and nane,
