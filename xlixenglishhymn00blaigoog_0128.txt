108 ΟΝ THE BRlNK

The bride eyes not her garment,

But her dear bridegroom’s face;
I will not gaze at glory,

But on my King of grace,-
Not at the crown He gifteth

But on His pierced hand:
The Lamb is all the glory

Of Immanuel's land.

I've wrestled on towards heaven,

'Gainst storm and wind and tide;
Now, like a weary traveller

That leaneth on his guide3
Amid the shades oi evening,

While sinks liie's lingering sand,
Ι hail the glory dawning

In Immanuel’s land.

XLVI

Os all the thoughts of God that are

Borne inward into souis afar,
Along the Psalmist's music deep,

Now tell meis that any is,

For gift or grace, surpassing this—
‘He giveth His beloved sleep’?

What would we give to our beloved?
The hero's heart to be unmoved,
The poet's star-tuned harp to sweep,
