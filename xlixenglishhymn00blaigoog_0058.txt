THE GOSPEL INVITATION

Ο praise the Father ; praise the Son;
Blest Spirit, praise to Thee:
All praise to God, the Three in One,
The One in Three!

XVII

Ι nonno the voice of Jesus say,
‘Come unto Me and rest3

Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast':

Ι came to Jesus as Ι was,
Weary‚ and worn, and sad 3

Ι found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
‘Behold, Ι sreely give
The living water 3 thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink, and live ἐ
Ι came to Jesus, and Ι drank
Ol that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched‚ my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

1 heard the voice of Jesus say,
‘I am this dark world's Light ;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall nse,
And all thy day be bright 'z
