DISCIPLINE

Though dark my path and sad my lot,
Let me be still and murmur not,

Or breathe the prayer Divinely taught,
‘Thy will be done.'

What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Submissive still would Ι reply,

‘Thy will be done.'

If Thou shouldst call me to resign

What most Ι prize, it ne’er was mine,

I only yield Thee what was Thine:
Thy will be done.

Should pining siclmess waste away

My life in premature decay,

My Father, still I strive to say,
‘Thy will be done.'

Let but my fainting heart be blest

With Thy sweet Spirit forits guest,

My God, to Thee I leave the rest:
Thy will be done.

Renew my will from day to day3
Blend it with Thine; and take away

All that now makes it hard to say
‘Thy will be done.'
