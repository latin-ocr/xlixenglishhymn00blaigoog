HEAVEN

My Father's house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times, to faith's foreseeing eye,
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah! then my spirit saints

To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints
Jerusalem above.

For ever with the Lord!
Father, if ’tis Thy will,

The promise of that faithful word
Even here to me fulfil.
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail,

Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand
F ight, and I must prevail.

So, when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,

By death l shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,

And oft repeat before the throne,
‘For ever with the Lord !’
