GOD THE FATHER

When in the night Ι sleepless lie,

My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,

No powers of darkness me molest.

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow3
Praise Him, all creatures here below3
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host3
Praise Father‚ Son, and Holy Ghost.

Ο Gon os Bethel, by whose hand
Thy people still are sed,

Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led,

Our vows, our prayers we now present
Before Thy throne os grace3

God of our fathers, be the God
of their succeeding race.

Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide3

Give us each day our daily breed,
And raiment fit provide.

O spread Thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease,

And at our Father’s loved abode
¹ Our souls arrive in peace.
