JESUs cflRlST

‘All His work is ended,
Joyfully we sing3

‘Jesus hath aseended3
Glory to our King !'

He who came to save us,

He who bled and died,
Now is crowned with glory ·

At His Father's side.
Never more to suffer,

Never more to die,
Jesus, King of Glory,

Is gone up on high.

‘All His work,’ etc.

Praying for¹His children

In that blessbd place,
Calling them to glory‚

Sending them His grace.
His bright home preparing,

Faithful ones, for you,
Jesus ever liveth‚

Ever loveth too.
‘All His work‚' etc.

XIV

THE Head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now;

A royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor's brow.
