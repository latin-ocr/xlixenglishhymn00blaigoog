92 THE chonen

Thou wast their Roth, their Fortress, and their Might3 '

Thou, Lord‚ their Captain in the well-fought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear‚ their one true Light.
Hallelujah ἔ

Ο may Thy soldiers‚ faithful, true, and hold,
Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,

And win, with them, the victor’s crown of gold.
Hallelujah ἔ

Ο blest communion, fellowship Divine!

We feebly struggle, they in glory shine3

Yet all are one in Thee‚ for all are Thine.
Hallelujah ἔ

And when the strife isfierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,

And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
Hallelujah t

The golden evening brightens in the west3
Soon, soon to faithful warriors eometh rest3

Sweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.
Hallelujah ἔ

But, lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day:

The saints triumphant rise in bright array3

The King of Glory passes on His way.
Hallelujah !

From earth's wide bounds‚ from ocean’s furthest coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
Singing to Father‚ Son, and Holy Ghost‚

‘ Hallelujah !'
