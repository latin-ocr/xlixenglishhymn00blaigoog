TRUST AND PEACE

My never-failing treasury‚ filled
With boundless stores of grace.

By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,
Although with sin defiled ;

Satan accuses me in vain,
And I am owned a child.

JesuS, my Shepherd‚ Husband, Friend‚
My Prophet, Priest, and King, e

My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise Ι bring.

Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought3

But, when Ι see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought.

Till then I would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath3

And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.

XXVI

SUN of my sonl, Thou Saviour dear,

It is not night if Thou be nea13

Ο may no earth-born cloud arise

To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.
