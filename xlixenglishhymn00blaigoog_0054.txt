Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph os His train:

Hallelujah l
God appears on earth to reign.

Every eye shall now behold Him,
Robed in dreadful majesty3
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced, and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing,
· Shall the true Messiah see.

Every island, sea, and mountain,
Heaven and earth, shall flee away;
All who hate Him must, confounded,
Hear the trump proclaim the day:
Come to judgment!
Come to judgment! corne away!

Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear;
All His saints, by man rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the airi
Hallelujah i

See the day of God appear!

Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne3
Saviour, tale the power and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own:
O come quickly;
Hallelujah! corne, Lord, cornel
