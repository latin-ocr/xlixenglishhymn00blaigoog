TRUST AND PEACE

XXII

Jews, Lover ol my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom lly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high3
Hide me, Ο my Saviour, hide,
Till the storin ol lise is past3
Safe into the haven guide3
Ο receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have Ι none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee3
Leave, ah! leave me not alone3
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed3
All my help from Thee Ι bring ;

Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow ol Thy wing.

Thou, Ο Christ, art all Ι want;
More than all in Thee Ι find3
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sich, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness3
False and full ol sin Ι am,
Thou art lull os truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin 3
