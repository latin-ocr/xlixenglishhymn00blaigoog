106

ΟΝ THE BRINK

Dark‚ dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.

Ο Christ! He is the sountain,
The deep, sweet well os love3

The streams on earth I’ve tasted
More deep I'll drink above3

¹ There to an ocean sulness

His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.

With mercy and with judgment

My web of time He wove‚
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred by His love3
I’ll bless the hand that guided‚
I'll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Innmanuel's land.

Ο, Ι am my Beloved’s‚

And my Beloved is mine3
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into His house of wine.

I stand upon His merit3
I know no other stand,

- Not even where glory dwelleth

In Immanuel's land.
