JESUS CHRIST

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord3
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail, the incarnate Deity,
Pleased as Man with man to dwell,
JesuS, our Immanuel t

Hark! etc.

Hail‚ the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail‚ the Sun ot Righteousness!
Light and lise to all He brings,
Risen with healing In His wings.
Mild He lays His gloty by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! etc.

VIII

AT even, ere the sun was set,
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;

O in what divers pains they met!
O with what joy they went away!

Once more 'tis eventide, and we,
Oppressed with various ills, draw near ;
What is Thy form we cannot see,
We know and feel that Thou art here.
