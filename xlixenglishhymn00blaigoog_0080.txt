DISCIPLINE

When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep‚

Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour's breast.

Abide with me from mom till eve,
For without Thee Ι cannot live 3
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

If some poor wandering child of Thine
Have spurned today the voice Divino,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin 3
Let him no more lie down in sin.

Wateh by the sick3 enrich the poor

With blessings from Thy houndless store3
Be every mourner's sleep to-night,

Like infant's slumbers‚ pure and light.

Come near and bless us when we wake,
Ere through the world our way we take,
Till in the ocean of Thy love

We lose ourselves in heaven above.

XXVII

Mu God and Father, while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way,

Ο teach me from my heart to say,
‘Thy will be done'
