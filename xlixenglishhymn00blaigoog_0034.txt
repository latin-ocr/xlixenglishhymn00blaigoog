JESUS cflrrs‘r

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread

Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him sor His grace ;
Behind a srowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour3

The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.

Blind unbelief is sure to err,

And scari His work in vain3
' God is His own interpreter, ⁸
And He will make it plain.

VII

Hirr! the herald angels sing,
‘Glory to the new-born King,
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled !'
Joyful, all ye metiens, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies,
With the angelie host proclaim,
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem.'
Hark! etc.
