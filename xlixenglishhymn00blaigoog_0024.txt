GOD THE FATHER

Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope sor years to come,

Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home.

Panse to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise—

In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.

Ο loving wisdom of our God!
When all was sin and shame,

A second Adam to the fight
And to the rescue came.

Ο wisest love! that flesh and blood,
Which did in Adam fail,

Should strive afresh against the soe,
Should strive and should prevail ;

And that a higher gist than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence, and His very self

And essence all-Divine.

Ο generous love! that He who smote
In Man, forman, the soe

The double agony in Man,
For man, should underg0,
