For me, my heart that erst did go
¹ Most like a tired child at a show, 1
That sees through tears the mummers leap,
Would now its wearied vision close,
Would child-like on His love repose
Who giveth His belovod sleep.

And friends, dear friends, when it shall be
That this low breath is gone from me,
And round my bier you come to weep,
Let One, most loving of you all,
Say, ‘Not a tear must o'erhersa113
“ He giveth His belovod sleep.'”

TnRouon the love of God our Saviour
All will be well.

Free and changeless is His favou13
All, all is well.

Precious is the blood that healed us,

Perfect is the grace that sealed us,

Strong the hand stretehed forth to shield us;
All must be well.

Though we pass through tribulation‚
All will be well.

Ours is such a sull salvation‚
All, all is well.
