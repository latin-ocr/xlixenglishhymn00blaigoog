THE CHURCH

Like the wandering dove that found

No repose on earth around‚
They can to their arlr repen,
And enjoy it ever there.

Happy souls! their praises flow
Even in this vale of woe3

Waters in the desert rise‚

Manna feeds thern from the skies;
On they go' srorn strength to strength,
Till they reach Thy throne at length,
At Thy feet adoring tall,

Who hast led thern sale through all.

Lord, be mine this prize to win:
Guide me through a world of sin 3
Keep me by Thy saving grace3

Give me at Thy side a place.

Sun and shield alilre Thou art3

Guide and guard my ersing heart.
Grace and glory flow frorn Thee 3
Shower, O shower thern, Lord, on me.

XL

F on all the saints who from their labours rest,
Who Thee by saith before the world confessed

Thy name, O lesus, be for ever blest.
Halleluy‘ah l
