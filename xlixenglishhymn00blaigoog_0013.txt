PREFATORY NOTE

Tuusa essays in rhyming Latin were the recreation
of my father aster his retirement in his seventy·eighth
year from active clerical and professorial worlr His
last act before he was suddenly stricken down was
to send the translations to me to look over, and to
put into type if I thought right. He did not intend
to publish thern, and he never saw them in print;
but had he done 50, there is little doubt that he would

have altered and amended much.

These translations, therefore, may be considered

first experiments rather than finished work, yet as such
they may be of interest to those who knew my father

and who loved him.
