THE GOSPEL INVITATION

I looked to Jesus‚ and Ι found
In Him my Stat, my Sun3

And in that light ol life I’ll walk
Tlll travelling days are done.

‘ART thou weary‚ art thou languid‚
Art thou sore distressed?
“Come to Me,'' saith One, “and coming,
Be at rest.’''

‘Hath He marks to lead me to Him
1r Hebe my guidel’

. ‘ln His leet and hands are mund-prims,
And His side !'

‘Is there diadem, as Monarch,
That His brow adornsP' Ι
‘Yea‚ a crown in very surety‚
But of thorns l'

‘If I find Him, ir Ι follow,
What His guerdon here l'
‘Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear! '

‘Is Ι still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last?’
‘Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,
Jordan passed !'
