GOD THE FATHER

And in the garden secretly‚
And on the cross on high,

Should teach His brethren‚ and inspire
To suffer and to die.

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be prame,-

In all His words most wonderful,
Most sure in all His ways.

III

Am praise to Thee, my God, this night,
For all the blessings of the light!

Keep me, Ο keep me, King of kings,
Beneath Thy own almighty wings.

Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ill that I this day have done,

That with the world, mysels‚ and Thee '
Ι, ere Ι sleep, at peace may be.

Teach me to live, that Ι may dread
The grave as little as my bed;
To die, that this vile body may

Rise glorious at the awsul day.

Ο may my soul on Thee repose,

And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close,—
Sleep that may me more vigorous make
To serve my God when I awake.
