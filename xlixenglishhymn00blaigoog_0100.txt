HOLY ASPIRATION

XXXV

Gon of my life, to Thee I call⁴ 3
Afflicted at Thy feet 1 fa113

When the great water-floods premii,
Leave not my trembling heart to fail.

Friend of the friendless and the saint,
Where should I lodge my deep complaint?
Where but with Thee, whose open door
Invites the helpless and the poor?

Did ever mourner plead with Thee,
And Thou resuse that mourner’s plea? ·
Does not the word still fixed remain‚

That none shall seek Thy sace in vain?

That were a grief Ι could not bear,
Didst Thou not hear and answer praye13
Buta prayer-hearing, -answering God
Supports me under every load.

Fair is the lot that 's castior me;

I have an Advocate with Thee3
They whom the world caresses most
Have no such privilege to boast.

Poor though I am, despised‚ forgot,

Yet God, my God, forgets me not 3

And he is saie, and must succeed‚

For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.
