64 DISCIPLINE

Then‚ when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,

I’ll sing upon a happier shore,
‘Thy will be done.'

· XXVIII ¹

My times are in Thy hand:
My God, I wish them there3

My life, my friends, my soul I leave
Entirely to Thy care.

My times are in Thy hand:
Why should I doubt or leat?
My F ather’s hand will never cause

His child a needless tear.

. My times are in Thy hand,
Jesus‚ the Crucified3
Those hands my eruel sins had pierced
Are now my guard and guide.

My times are in Thy hand:
I'll always trust in' Thee ;

And, after death, at Thy right hand
Ι shall for ever be.
