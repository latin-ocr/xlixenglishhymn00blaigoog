THE HOLY SPIRIT

XVI

Ourr blest Redeemer‚ ere He breathed
His tender last fareneII,

A Guide, a Comforter bequeathed,
With us to dwell.

He carne in tongues of living flame
To teach, convince, subdue3
All-powerful as the wind He came,
As viewless too.

He came sveet influence to impart‚
A gracious‚ willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.

And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soit as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each sear,
And speaks of heaven.

And every virtue we possess,
And every victory von,
And every thought oi holiness
Are His alone.

Spirit of purity and grace,
Our veakness pitying, see ;
Ο make our hearts Thy dvelling-place,
And worthier Thee.
