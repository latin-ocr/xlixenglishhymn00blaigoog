Jasos crrmsr

The dying thiel rejoieed to see
That fountain in his day3
And there have Ι, as vile as he,
Washed all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power

Till all the ransomed Church os God
Be saved, to sin no more.

E'er since, by saith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,

Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,

When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silentio the grave.

Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared,
Unworthy though Ι be,

For me a blood-bought free reward,
A golden harp sor me,

'Tis strung and tuned lor endless years,
And formed, by power Divine,

To sound in God the Father’s ears
No other name but Thine.
