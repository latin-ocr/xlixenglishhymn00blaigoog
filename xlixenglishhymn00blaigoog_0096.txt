HOLY ASPIRATION

Where is the blessedness I knew
When first I saw the Lord? ¹

Where is the soul-refreshing view

Ol Jesns and His word?

What peacelul hours I once enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!

But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

Retnrn‚ Ο Holy Dove! return,

Sweet messenger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn‚

And drove Thee froin my breast.

The dearest idol I have known,
Whate’er that idol be,

Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and serene my srame 3

So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb.

O sinsin happy, timely nise,
mmmmmm,

Eyes that the bearn celestial view
Which evermore makes all things new!
