rusus curusr

O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel:
For some are sick‚ and some are sad,
And some have never loved Thee well,
And some have lost the love they had;

And some are pressed with worldly care,
And some are tried with sinful doubt3

And some such grievous passions tear
That only Thou canst cast them out ;

And some have found the world is vain,
Yet from the world they break not free;

And some have friends who give them pain,
And have not sought a friend in Thee;

And none, Ο Lord, have perfect rest,
For none are wholly lree stom sin3
And they who lain would serve Thee best
Are conscious most of wrong within.

O Saviour Christ, Thou too art Man;
Thou hast been troubled, tempted‚ tried3

Thy kind but searching glanee can scan
The very wounds that sharne would hide3

Thy touch has still its ancient power;
No word from Thee can fruitless fall:
Hear in this solemn evening hour,
And in Thy mercy heal us all.
