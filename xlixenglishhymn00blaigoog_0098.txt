HOLY ASPIRATION

New every morning is the love

Our walrening and uprising prove,

Through sleep and darkness safely brought,
Restored to lile, and power, and thought.

New mercies‚ each returning day,

Hover around us while we pray‚-

New perils past, new sins forgiven,

New thoughts os God, new hopes of heaven.

If, on our daily course, our mind
Be set to hallow all vve find,
N ew treasures still, of couutless price,

¹ God will provide sor sacrifice.

The trivial round, the common tasi,
Will lurnish all we ought to ask,—
Room to deny ourselves, a road

To bring us daily nearer God.

Seek we no more3 content with these,
Let present rapture, comfort, ease,

As heaven shall bid them, come and go:
The secret this of rest below.

Only, Ο Lord, in Thy dear love,
Fit us sor perfect rest above3
And help us, this and every day,
To live more nearly as we pray.
